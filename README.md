Pre-owned pro audio listings with local pickup in NYC

## Purpose

We will provide links to pro audio classifieds, enhancing them with our own
voice, resources and context. We will prefer low-cost or trade listings. We
will also create `feature` content including but not limited to:

* Purchase experiences
* In-depth reviews
* Arbitrage opportunities

We will manage a weekly mailing list that aggregates all posts from the past
week into a digest.

## Monetization

We will provide affiliate links to partner marketplaces that sell the gear in
the listings we link to. We will also provide links to accessories that
supplement the gear.

In the future, we may offer a `promoted post` feature for sellers.

### Potential Partners

* Reverb
* Sweetwater
* Guitar Center
* Ebay
* Amazon

## Profit Sharing

Authors will be paid as follows:

* Flate rate for each post
* Per-word rate for listing descriptions
* Percentage of affiliate income from their posts

`Feature` content will be compensated at a higher rate.

## Legal

Craigslist is a risky marketplace to work with. Craigslist asserts an
`exclusive` license on the content in their classifieds. This means we cannot
directly use *any* content (e.g: images, seller summary) in our links to the
listings. It is questionable if we can even use supplementary info like the
neighborhood, make / model or price of the item listed.

In general, we should prefer other marketplaces, especially those with
affiliate programs.

For each marketplace we will have to evaluate the image licensing situation. It
may be desirable to create an in-house database of gear images.
